# Application for AppCenter testing 

I understand this task as: 
1. Application ask about branches
2. For all branches app send requests for start build.
3. After build wait while build will be finished and return information about this build


In Console Application implement few functions.

With start Application asking branches for application from Enviroment variables.
After it you can:
1. update list of branches (press "-1") if you want to update list
2. Build all branches (press "0")
3. Build concrete branch (press number of branch)

If you select an build, the program will send a request for build, give a message that the build has started, and then wait for the build to finish. After it you will see a message about results.

Maybe I found the wrong version of the link for logs, I was just trying to understand it from the AppCenter Api
